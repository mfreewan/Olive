// The environments folder is another important directory within the src folder of a project.
// It is specifically used to store environment-specific configuration files.
//  Different environments such as development, staging, and production are used
//   in a typical project which requires different settings and variables.

// Inside the environments folder,
// developers can create separate configuration files for each environment.
//  These files usually contain variables and settings that are specific to the
//   corresponding environment. For example, API endpoints, database connection
//   strings, feature flags, or any other environment-specific variables can be defined in these configuration files.
